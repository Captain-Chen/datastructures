# data structures
learning and implementing data structures in JavaScript
## to use these data structure implementations
in a separate *.js* file define a new variable and use the keyword *require*. You can now create objects of that name by using the keyword *new*.
### example usage
```javascript
const HashTable = require('./HashTable')
let ht = new HashTable();
```
